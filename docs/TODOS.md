First:

- need to make the tests better
- make the zero_grad() function and module
- need to make the tanh backprop better
- need to make the NN more efficient
- leaf flag on which gradients to calculate

Extensions:

- figure out how to do MNIST in numpy
- can try to make this work with MNIST
- can make this work better with vectors and batches
- create some basic numpy function like numpy dot product
- can try to write some rudiementary CUDA code
